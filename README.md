# Setup Instructions
1. **Backend Setup**:
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Update `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL` in `utils/database.py` with your PostgreSQL credentials
   - Run the FastAPI server: `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000`

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Initialize Tailwind CSS: `npx tailwindcss init`
   - Run the development server: `npm start`

3. **Database**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
   - Create a database named `appointment_db`
   - The tables will be created automatically when the FastAPI server starts


   4. Create Admin using API and postman or swagger ui 

# Notes
- The backend follows the MVC pattern with clear separation of models, controllers, and views (API endpoints).
- All APIs include proper validation for mobile numbers, passwords, file uploads, and appointment timeslots.
- JWT authentication is implemented for secure access to protected routes.
- Background tasks are set up for daily appointment reminders using APScheduler.
- The frontend uses React with Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a responsive UI.
- Filtering and pagination are implemented for users and appointments.
- Monthly reports can be generated by admins, showing total patients, appointments, and earnings per doctor.
- The system supports three user types (Admin, Doctor, Patient) with appropriate access controls.

This implementation provides a complete, functional appointment booking system with all requested features and validations.
